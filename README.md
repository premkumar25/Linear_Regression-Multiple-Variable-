# Linear_Regression-Multiple-Variable-

In this I have created a linear regression model with mulitple variable to predict the salary for candidates. sklearn is used to predict the linear model and the prediction is stored in a .csv file. I have used PyChram as my IDE and I would recommed either PyChram or Jupyter notebooks.

Note: You can use this code as an example and create your own prediction model.
